2025 ONTARIO TEACHERS’ FINANCE TRUST – GREEN BOND REPORT  

Our 2025 Green Bond Report  
OTFT, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ontario Teachers’, is an established global issuer with outstanding bonds in U.S. dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling, and Canadian dollars. The framework is aligned with the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles and is summarized on the

TFT’s green bond issuance allows us to access capital to support the investments reviewed by S&P Global Shades of Green, which provides a second-party opinion on the quality of the framework and the governance around how assets are selected. The framework was updated in 2023.

Ontario Teachers’ Green Bond Framework describes four key elements of our green bond issuance: 

i) what assets the proceeds will be used for;  
ii) how the assets will be selected;  
iii) how the proceeds will be managed; and  
iv) how we will report back to bond investors.  

The framework maintained a “Dark Green” assessment by S&P Global Shades of Green, indicating, among other things, overall alignment with the International Capital Market Association’s (ICMA) Green Bond Principles.

Total issued: CAD$3.9 billion  
Rated:  
Moody’s: Aa1  
S&P: AAA  
DBRS: AAA

Impact Reporting  
On the next page, we report on certain quantitative and qualitative environmental performance indicators (“impact metrics”) on our Eligible Green Assets. The Eligible Green Assets as of December 31, 2024 fall into four main categories: i) renewable energy generation and transmission, ii) natural resources and land use, iii) climate change adaptation, and iv) pollution prevention and control.  

The Eligible Green Assets continue to be aligned with the principles set out in the EU Taxonomy ‘Do No Significant Harm.’ We make efforts to

Align our impact reporting with market practices and follow ICMA’s Handbook, Harmonised Framework for Impact Reporting (June 2024 edition), to identify relevant impact metrics for each category. Consistent with ICMA’s Framework, we collect and aggregate available impact metrics as reported and/or calculated by Eligible Green Assets in our Green Bond Register. We then allocate impact metrics according to proceeds as a percentage of each asset’s enterprise value. This practice is encouraged by ICMA’s Harmonised Framework for Impact Reporting, and we believe it reflects a conservative approach as the consideration of financing across the capital structure prevents double counting of impact, in the event that our partners or assets themselves issue green bonds.

The table includes the proportionate share of impact based on proceeds as of December 31, 2024. We have also pro-rated impacts attributable to green bond investors. Lastly, we specify which impacts are ex-post, or “after the fact” and based on actual measurements or estimations, and ex-ante, which uses estimates to gauge future performance. All metrics were independently reviewed by S&P Global Shades of Green.

Impact Metrics by Category and Ownership  
As of December 31, 2024, 49% of impact metrics are attributable to green bond investors. Most assets in our Green Bond Register were operational during 2024, and for these

Assets we provide ex-post metrics. Ex-post impact is based on the aggregated metric from the calendar year indicated. Assets that are starting operations in 2024 or beyond have impact metrics reported on an ex-ante basis. Ex-ante impact is based on annual estimates for an average year once the assets become operational. When assets have both ex-ante and ex-post metrics (i.e., a company has both assets in development and in operation), only ex-post metrics are considered.

Impact Metrics Measurement, Calculation and Commentary

Detailed below is the methodology, data sources and other information we use when calculating impact metrics. We collect available impact metrics reported and/or calculated by Eligible Green Assets in our Green Bond Register. We also provide commentary about year-over-year changes where relevant.

Impact Metrics Measurement and Calculation Methodology

• Renewable energy generated and/or transmitted and water produced and treated are directly measured by appropriate equipment at the asset level when ex-post metrics are presented, and reported by eligible assets in these categories.

• GHG emissions avoided from the renewable energy category are calculated in accordance with Greenhouse Gas (GHG) protocol, using country- and, when available, state- or provincial-specific emission factors in accordance with the technical guide available to the region. The data sources for the emission factors include the Central Electricity Authority of India; the International Energy Agency; U.S. Government Agencies; Taiwan’s Bureau of Energy.

Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs; and the United Kingdom Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). Values are presented in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e).

Total surface financed and certified is obtained from independent appraisal and certification reports. Certifications for the management system include Well Managed Plantation Certification in accordance with the Forest Stewardship Council’s Principles & Criteria, and third-party assessment in accordance with AS/NZS 4708 (Australian/New Zealand Standard for Sustainable Forest Management). The measurement of GHG emissions removed from the natural resource and land use category is based on eligible assets’ current best estimate from the measurement of timber- and non-timber related carbon stocks.

GHG emissions and/or local pollution avoided from the pollution prevention and control category are calculated and reported by eligible assets using independently reviewed comparative life-cycle assessment (LCA) in accordance with ISO 14040 and ISO 14044.

Ex-ante metrics are based on engineering and technical estimations, which are based on power generation capacity. Actual performance may vary due to weather, demand and/or operational conditions once the assets become operational.

We note that OTFT and OTPP do not account for the carbon avoidance and/or removals reported against their own carbon emissions – i.e., the emissions avoided and removed, as reported, are not netted.

Impact Metrics Analysis

Renewable Energy  
• The increase in ex-post renewable energy generated and/or transmitted is mainly due to increased output from existing Eligible Green Assets in this category.  
• Directly linked to the increase in renewable energy generation above, the ex-post GHG emissions avoided also increased in relation to the previous year.  
• The increase in ex-ante renewable energy generated and/or transmitted is mainly due to green bond proceeds being used to increase Eligible Green Assets in this category. This also resulted in an increase in ex-ante GHG emissions avoided.  

Energy Efficiency  
• There is no impact metric for 2024 under the Energy Efficiency category due to the removal of the associated assets from the Green Bond Register.  

Climate Change Adaptation  
• Water produced and treated was lower than the previous year due to a decrease in the annual production request associated with the existing Eligible Green Assets in this category.  

Pollution Prevention and Control  
• This is a new category added to the Eligible Green Assets.  

Natural Resources and Land Use  
• This is a new category added to the Eligible Green Assets.  

Green Asset Case Studies  
The following are examples of Eligible Green Assets included in our Green Bond Register as of December 31, 2024. In 2023, Ontario Teachers’ deployed additional capital to support the operation of Instagrid, a European technology company, in which Ontario Teachers’ acquired a 25% stake in 2022.

Stake investment in Scotland-based SSEN provides an alternative to off-grid power and the 2022 acquisition of a renewable Transmission, an electricity transmission solutions. Its innovative portable battery energy portfolio of approximately 2 gigawatts, comprised of four newly constructed and nine operating wind, solar and energy storage assets across power markets in the U.S. In 2021, OTPP acquired a 50% direct interest in a portfolio of 13 wind, solar and hydro energy storage assets across the U.S., managed by NextEra. Together, these assets have a generating capacity of approximately 4.5 gigawatts. 

SSEN Transmission’s network transports electricity generated from renewable resources – including onshore and offshore wind and hydro – from the north of Scotland to areas of demand across the United Kingdom, thereby supplying this electricity to more than 3.8 million homes and businesses. In addition, those portable battery systems contribute to significantly lower levels of certain local air pollutants during usage if used instead of gasoline or diesel generators. Instagrid’s flagship product serves professionals working in off-grid locations such as construction workers and emergency responders.

Cautionary Statement

“Green,” “green asset,” “green bonds,” and similar terms in this report refer to OTPP’s internal criteria, not any specific regulatory definitions. Our Green Bond Framework is informed by various laws, guidelines, taxonomies, methodologies, frameworks, market practices, and other standards (collectively, “Standards”).

Given the ongoing evolution of the definition of “green,” these Standards may change over time. If any Standards change significantly, we may need to update our Green Bond Framework and this report, including our categories of Eligible Green Assets.

Because any forward-looking information and statements are based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond Ontario Teachers’ control or are subject to change, actual results or events could be materially different. Although Ontario Teachers’ believes that the estimates and assumptions inherent in the forward-looking information and statements are reasonable, such information and statements are not guarantees of future performance and, accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on them.

Due reliance on such information or statements due to the inherent uncertainty therein. We also made good faith assumptions and estimates in our Green Bond Framework and reporting, including in respect of our impact metrics and reporting. Although we believe these assumptions and estimates are reasonable, they may prove incorrect or inaccurate for reasons we cannot foresee or predict. 

These assumptions and estimates relate to, among other things, the growth, outlook, and strategy of our business, the ability of our portfolio companies to make changes, the feasibility of third-party decarbonization and energy transition scenarios, the development and availability of low-carbon technologies, and the ability of certain assets and activities to displace or remove greenhouse gas emissions or local air pollution. Additionally, they consider economic and political trends, stakeholder participation, and the evolution of legal regimes and policies to address climate change. 

To monitor and report on our Green Bond Framework, we rely on data obtained from our portfolio companies and other third-party sources. Although we believe these sources are reliable, we have not independently verified this data or assessed the assumptions underlying such data, and cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness. The data may be of varying quality or usefulness and may change over time as standards evolve. These factors could impact and cause us to update our Green Bond Framework and this report.

Assumptions are incorrect, our report may be inaccurate. The standards, metrics, and measurements used are evolving and based on reasonable assumptions at the time of this report but could change or be replaced by alternate standards, metrics, and measurements.
